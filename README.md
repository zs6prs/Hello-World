# Hello-World
My 1st raspatory test in GitHub

Info about me 
My name is Peter Roos

This is my first ever read me file done on github
I think I like this, Hope I'll find the time to make stuff
I enjoy playing with Arduino's and Electronics
I normally have alot of ideas, but dont have a dedicated area for my ideas.

Ive used Git hub in the past to get arduino lib and made changes to them 
I found as time whent by so many of my projects disapeared or got messed up by trying to add new features and overwriting the main Project 

Thus the branches and main makes so much sense.

Pretty cool
